# network-inference-by-aracne-in-R

## Overview

The **net_inf.Rmd** script provides mutual information-based methods for the genome-wide reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks, implemented in [Minet R package](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-461). Here, we use [ARACNE](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-7-S1-S7) to infer a gene regulatory network from a [data set](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119931) of 27123 genes and 6 samples. For further details about pre-processing steps (normalization and noise elimination), please refer to https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/blob/master/scripts/01_normalisation.md.
